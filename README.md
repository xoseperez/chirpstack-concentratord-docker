ChirpStack Concentratord is an open-source LoRa(WAN) concentrator daemon, part of the ChirpStack project. It requires other components in order to build a viable LoRaWAN solution. Either a chirpstack-gateway-bridge, a chirpstack-gateway-relay, a chirpstack-udp-forwarder or a chirpstack-mqtt-forwarder plus a LNS solution like ChirpStack LNS.
